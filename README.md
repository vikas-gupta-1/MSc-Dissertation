## Project Overview

This project examines how exchange rate volatility influences stock returns and risk dynamics of export-oriented firms in the United States and Europe over the period 2010–2024.

The analysis focuses on EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuations and evaluates both return sensitivity and volatility behavior across firms and regions. The study incorporates major global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine war to understand how external events affect equity markets and firm-level risk.

The project demonstrates applied financial analysis, risk modeling, and empirical research using real-world market data and Python.

- European firms exhibit stronger sensitivity to currency volatility than U.S. firms  
- Volatility responds more strongly to global shocks than average returns  
- U.S. firms show longer volatility persistence, while European firms react more sharply to shocks  
- Firm-level characteristics dominate macroeconomic variables in explaining short-term returns
